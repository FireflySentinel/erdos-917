# Community contribution preparation: Erdős 917

Prepared locally on 2026-09-07. The external proof refutes the general asymptotic formula at k = 12. The k = 6 question remains open. Toft's quadratic lower bound is recorded as a known result, without a formal-proof attribute pointing to this repository.

## Files

- [Formal Conjectures statement](formal-conjectures/FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/917.lean)
- [Proof bridge](../checks/FormalConjecturesBridge.lean)
- [Formal Conjectures PR draft](formal-conjectures/PR.md)
- [Proposed database entry](teorth/entry.yaml) and [patch](teorth/problems.patch)
- [Pinned upstream revisions](upstream.json)

The statement file follows Formal Conjectures' placeholder convention. The bridge
contains complete proofs for every declaration with a `formal_proof` link and
checks their axiom dependencies. It copies the definitions and theorem types,
omitting the contribution attributes and the identity elaborator `answer`.
`check_bridge.py` compares those sources; Lean checks the proofs.

## Reproduce the checks

In this repository, using its pinned Lean 4.33.0 toolchain:

```sh
python3 submissions/check_bridge.py
lake env lean -DwarningAsError=true checks/FormalConjecturesBridge.lean
```

In a Formal Conjectures checkout at the revision in `upstream.json`, copy the
prepared `917.lean` to `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/917.lean`, then run:

```sh
lake --wfail build 'FormalConjectures.ErdosProblems.«917»'
```

The latter was checked with upstream's Lean 4.33.1 toolchain. The Mathlib
source files are identical at the two pinned revisions. Pass
`--upstream /path/to/formal-conjectures` to `check_bridge.py` to verify both the
upstream revision and the copied file. The two projects remain separate;
this repository has no dependency on upstream's placeholder theorems.

## Database proposal

The patch changes only `formal_status`. It keeps the current `informal_status`
and leaves the generated `status` and `formalized` fields untouched.
The combined three-problem patch and PR draft are in the erdos-1132 repository,
under `submissions/teorth/`. The upstream validator accepts the combined patch
against the saved base revision.

For #917, the proposed Lean status refers specifically to the general asymptotic
question, as the entry's note says. The contribution guide does not explicitly
specify how `formal_status` aggregates partially answered multi-part problems;
the PR draft flags this point for the maintainer. It does not claim that all
three questions have formal solutions.

Neither contribution process requires an arXiv link.

The external proof links point to fixed commits of the proved results.
The community submissions are prepared here for separate review.
Before an actual Formal Conjectures submission, check the Google CLA and coordinate
on the existing issue. Its adopted [Mathlib AI policy](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html#use-of-ai)
requires tool/use disclosure, the `LLM-generated` label for substantial generated
code, and personally written review comments. The draft includes the disclosure.
